# Django Rest Framework Homework

Your task is to implement the simple API for the book store.
For it, you ned to describe Book and Author entities; 
implement endpoints for a single book and a single author, and endpoint for lists of authors and books; 
describe the Manager entity and implement logic, when only the manager can add a new book or author or update them.

As a bonus, you can implement Customer entity and logic with a customer cart, where user can store books that he/she wants to buy. 
To do this, you need to implement endpoint for books in cart for a single user. 

Good luck :)
